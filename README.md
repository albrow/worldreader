WorldReader
===========

Screen readers read your screen. WorldReader reads the world around you.

WorldReader is an android app designed to help blind people navigate and understand
their surroundings. Just point your phone, and WorldReader will attempt to identify
the object you're looking at and say it out loud.

Check out this [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJAwI3yJdRc)!

### How it works:

Press the volume keys to start or stop the continuous capture process. While running,
WorldReader will continuously take pictures of your surroundings. After compressing
and processing the images, it sends them to an API for recognition and categorization.
The app then parses the API response and uses a TTS engine to read the best guesses out
loud.
